The operating system basically manages all the resources of the computer, and acts as an interface between the software and the computer hardware. It also interprets commands from user to hardware, controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer. - application programs/Operating systems examples, (windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, 10, and windows 11 to name a few), Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS </p>Definition of Computer Operating Systems Security <br> - Computer Operating System Security basically is the protection of computer systems and information from harm such as theft, threats, viruses, worms, malware, hacker and unauthorized use. <p> Security Threats <br>- A security threat is something that is potentially violating someone’s computer system. This can mean someone hacking into a computer and getting someone's information. This makes people vulnerable to identity theft and losing their valuable and private information. </p><p> Malicious Tools/threats - Software threats are called malware. <br>- Some are Click Bait - Click bait is a text or pop up that attracts the attention of the users. It can be dangerous because people are vulnerable to getting hacked or giving their information to the wrong person. To avoid click bait you should not click on random pop ups or websites that come on your screen. You can also get a security or virus scan on your computer in order to stop click bait from popping up.<br>- Back Doors- This is a way in which someone gains access to a computer, bypassing authentication security. Example people can hack an installed application software in your computer and then use it as a back door tool to penetrate into your system. <br>- Trojan Horse- A Trojan horse installs and activates on a computer by appearing to be something harmless which computer users unknowingly install in their system. - Computer Hardware Theft- This is the process of stealing your computer itself, for example a Laptop which is portable and easy to carry, or a component like the Hard Drive that has the computer data.  </p>";

When it does this it keeps a record of where the file data is stored on the disk. Like storage management it User properties can’t be accessed unless you get permission by changing the Administrator in system files. <br>● File system is a storage structure on the computer that organizes the data it allows users quick access to. On windows there are three different file systems NTFS, Fat32, fat16. <br>- NTFS: meaning New technology file system it proprietary journaling file system Starting with Windows NT 3.1, it is the default file system of the Windows NT family. It superseded File Allocation Table as the preferred file system on Windows and is supported in Linux and BSD. <br>- Fat32: a disk format or filing system used to organize the files stored on a disk drive <br>- Fat16: meaning File allocation table was used back in 1970 built for 16 byte file systems and was developed to run on Floppy disk. </p><p> ● Storage management: is the way organizations deliver fast access to data while ensuring data integrity, policy and regulatory compliance, and efficient storage resource use. It involves developing a plan to provision, configure, back up, and monitor data storage infrastructure to maintain performance, prevent data loss, and quickly address problems. <br>● There are many more systems and files in place like FTP, NFS, NAS, and SAN etc that help manage storage on our computer. <br>-FTP(File transfer protocol) secure file transfer that use shell encryption for high level security to send file transfers. <br>-NFS(Network file system) for storing files on a network <br>-NAS(Network attached storage) file dedicated storage device that contains data for employees to collaborate over a network.</p>";

It provides the necessary interfaces and pathways for these components to communicate and work together to perform computing tasks. Here's how hardware interfaces with the motherboard to perform computing tasks: <br>● GPU: -The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized hardware component designed primarily for rendering graphics, but modern GPUs are also used for general-purpose computing tasks through a framework known as General-Purpose GPU computing (GPGPU).</p>";

Here are some main points and descriptions regarding memory management: <br>-Memory Allocation: Memory allocation involves assigning portions of memory to programs or processes for their use. There are various allocation strategies, including contiguous allocation (where memory is divided into fixed-size partitions) and dynamic allocation (where memory is allocated and deallocated as needed). <br>Memory Addressing: Memory addressing refers to the process of assigning unique identifiers (addresses) to memory locations, allowing programs to access and manipulate data stored in memory. Different addressing modes, such as direct, indirect, and indexed addressing, provide flexibility in how programs access memory. <br>Memory Protection: Memory protection mechanisms prevent unauthorized access to memory locations, enhancing system security and stability. This includes techniques such as segmentation and paging, which partition memory to isolate processes and protect against memory-related errors. In summary, memory management encompasses a range of techniques and processes aimed at efficiently allocating, protecting, and releasing memory resources to support the execution of programs in computer systems. These practices are essential for optimizing system performance, ensuring stability, and enhancing security.</p>";

Also responsible for some memory management. Kernel remains in memory until the operating system is shut down. The Kernel also decides which processes should be allocated to processors to be executed and which ones should stay in memory. In essence it's responsible for managing all your resources. <br>●	Drivers: device drivers are programs within the kernel that allows for communication between the OS software and the computer's hardware by telling it how to function. When the system starts up it runs the bios which stands for Basic input and output system. <br>●	Shell: the shell provides a way for users to interact with the operating system. Essentially it is an interpreter of commands that are used to communicate with the system. Terminal: The terminal is the Text based user interface which helps the user communicate with the shell. The terminal and the shell work together to make the user's experience easier when speaking to the operating system. Used to communicate to the shell. <br>●	System calls: A system call is when a system wants to access hardware resources like storage or ram so it sends a request to the kernel. The kernel accesses the requested hardware and gives a response. </p>";
